He charged the ranks of the goblins of Mount Gram in the Battle of the Green Fields, and knocked their king Golfirnbul's head clean off with a wooden club.	It sailed a hundred yards through the air and went down a rabbit hole, and in this way the battle was won and the game of Golf invented at the same moment. In the meanwhile, however, Bullroarer's gentler descendant was reviving in the drawing-room.  After a while and a drink he crept nervously to the door of the parlour.
