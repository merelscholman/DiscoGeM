To say we need a constitution is not to say that the European Union should have the constitution of a state, for the Union is not a state and is not about to become one.	Manifestly we do exist and therefore manifestly we already have some kind of a constitution.	The question is : do we have an adequate constitution and what kind of constitution do we want?

However, having said that, the crucial matter is not the existence of a Charter but the proper safeguarding of the citizen, and the means by which the citizen achieves such protection today vary from Member State to Member State.	In view of the Community's normal legislative practice, I am somewhat surprised that it was not felt that this should be achieved by going with the grain of the established legal and administrative mechanisms of each Member State.

The problem is that some have not and will not, so this means that the proposed regulation goes beyond the strict terms of Dublin by guessing at or anticipating the existence of an asylum application. Thus the Dublin Convention is, in the words of the UK House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities, a shaky edifice on which to construct a system for taking and exchanging fingerprint data on those who have not yet made or may not make an asylum application.	This is a legally uncertain basis for legislation and that makes me unhappy.
