**********************************

itemworker-forced_vs_free.csv contains the annotation of each item by each worker using either or both approaches.

itemid_forced	: item id of the item annotated by the specific worker using the forced-choice approach 
                (empty: the item was not annotated by this worker using the forced-choice approach)
workerid_forced	: worker id of the worker who annotated the specific item using the forced-choice approach 
                (empty: the item was not annotated by this worker using the forced-choice approach)
dc_forced	:  DC selected using the forced choice approach by the specific worker on the specific item, if annotated
lev3_forced	: Level3 relation label represented by the DC annotated by the forced choice approach, if annotated
lev2_forced	: Level2 relation label represented by the DC annotated by the forced choice approach, if annotated
itemid_free	: item id of the item annotated by the specific worker using the free-choice approach 
              (empty: the item was not annotated by this worker using the free-choice approach)
workerid_free	: worker id of the worker who annotated the specific item using the free-choice approach 
                (empty: the item was not annotated by this worker using the free-choice approach)
dc_free_step1	: DC typed by the specific worker on the specific item during the first step of the free-choice approach, if annotated
dc_free_step2	: DC selected by the specific worker on the specific item during the second step of the free-choice approach, if annotated
lev3_free_step1	: Level3 relation label(s) represented by the DC typed in the first step of the free-choice approach, if annotated
lev2_free_step1 : Level2 relation label(s) represented by the DC typed in the first step of the free-choice approach, if annotated
lev3_free_step2 : Level3 relation label(s) represented by the DC selected in the second step of the free-choice approach, if annotated
lev2_free_step2 : Level2 relation label(s) represented by the DC typed in the second step of the free-choice approach, if annotated
